# COSC420
COSC420 Neural Networks Assignment

## Getting Started
1. Set up your python environment, making sure that the packages in the `environment.yml` file are installed.
    If you are using conda you can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    This will create a new conda environment called 'cosc420'.
2. Run one of the main scripts, e.g. `xor.py`.
