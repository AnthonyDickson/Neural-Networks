# COSC420
COSC420 Neural Networks Assignment

## Getting Started
1.  Set up your python environment.

    If you are using conda you can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    This will create a new conda environment called 'cosc420' which should be used for running code in this project.

    Otherwise, ensure that your python environment has the packages listed in `environment.yml` installed.

2.  For running the back-propagation visualisation demo in `demos` you will need a working installation of GraphViz.
    This can be found [here](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
3.  Try out one of demos in `demos`!
